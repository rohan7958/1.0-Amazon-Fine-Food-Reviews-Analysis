🎯 Objective:
The goal of this project is to determine whether a review is positive or negative. A rating of 4 or 5 is considered positive, while a rating of 1 or 2 is considered negative. Reviews with a rating of 3 are ignored.

🤔 How to determine if a review is positive or negative?
The Score/Rating of a review is used as a proxy way to determine the polarity of a review. However, it is important to note that this is an approximate way of determining the positivity or negativity of a review.
